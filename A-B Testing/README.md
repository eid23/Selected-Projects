## A/B Testing Project

The project was aimed at checking whether the process of A/B testing was correct and interpreting A/B testing results. The *objective* of A/B test was to evaluate the efficiency of new recommendation system in terms of conversion rates in experiment group (B) compared to control group (A).

The *dataset* included the data on marketing events, new users, new user events, and test participants.

To implement the project I used *pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, math, seaborn and plotly* libraries. 

To compare conversion rates, user cohorts were formed and funnel metrics calculated. Z-tests were used to perform statistical analysis.

The project demonstrated that, due to initial deficiencies of A/B test, the difference between conrol group and experimental groups are not statistically significant, while the third metric was higher in the control group. Deficiencies in A/B test were documented and recommendations for improvement drawn.

The project was implemented during Yandex.Practicum course in January 2023.
